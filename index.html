HOWES, CPA If you own a business…  Besides owning and operating my accounting practices, I have owned several other successful businesses.  Besides analyzing the tax code and helping clients comply with all State and Federal regulations, much of my experience has been what all successful business owners do.  Set up and design computer operations for your business, create and implement marketing plans, hire (and fire) and supervise employees, make purchasing and inventory decisions, negotiate leases, purchase contracts, insurance, etc., etc., and all the other hats you must wear when owning and operating a business.  I have purchased and sold businesses and been hired by others to help them do the same.  I have arbitrated investor disputes for the NASD and taught tax courses at the college level.  When you choose me to be your tax and business adviser, you don’t just get a person who fills out forms for a living, you get someone who has been through the ups and downs of business ownership.  Let me help you make well informed, good business decisions  If you need personal tax assistance…  I have 25 years of experience doing tax related work.  Some of those years also owned other businesses as well.  I have worked for large and small CPA firms, been a partner in a CPA firm and owned my own firm for the last 12 years.  Wide variety of people and businesses have used my services.  Wage earners, homeowners, salespeople, doctors, nurses, dentists, realtors, ma and pop stores, truckers, franchisees, teachers, retirees, CEOs, investors, landlords, non-resident aliens, people divorcing, estate beneficiaries, non-profits, you-name-it… have used and continue to use my services.  So I have experience with all kinds of tax issues and have found well-researched solutions to those issues.  I have also represented numerous people before the Internal Revenue Service (even representing a colleague, a local tax practitioner-CPA who was audited) and state taxing authorities.  No matter who you are…  Call or email me for a no-obligation meeting to discuss your needs.  Thank you.

HOWES, CPA If you own a business…  Besides owning and operating my accounting practices, I have owned several other successful businesses.  Besides analyzing the tax code and helping clients comply with all State and Federal regulations, much of my experience has been what all successful business owners do.  Set up and design computer operations for your business, create and implement marketing plans, hire (and fire) and supervise employees, make purchasing and inventory decisions, negotiate leases, purchase contracts, insurance, etc., etc., and all the other hats you must wear when owning and operating a business.  I have purchased and sold businesses and been hired by others to help them do the same.  I have arbitrated investor disputes for the NASD and taught tax courses at the college level.  When you choose me to be your tax and business adviser, you don’t just get a person who fills out forms for a living, you get someone who has been through the ups and downs of business ownership.  Let me help you make well informed, good business decisions  If you need personal tax assistance…  I have 25 years of experience doing tax related work.  Some of those years also owned other businesses as well.  I have worked for large and small CPA firms, been a partner in a CPA firm and owned my own firm for the last 12 years.  Wide variety of people and businesses have used my services.  Wage earners, homeowners, salespeople, doctors, nurses, dentists, realtors, ma and pop stores, truckers, franchisees, teachers, retirees, CEOs, investors, landlords, non-resident aliens, people divorcing, estate beneficiaries, non-profits, you-name-it… have used and continue to use my services.  So I have experience with all kinds of tax issues and have found well-researched solutions to those issues.  I have also represented numerous people before the Internal Revenue Service (even representing a colleague, a local tax practitioner-CPA who was audited) and state taxing authorities.  No matter who you are…  Call or email me for a no-obligation meeting to discuss your needs.  Thank you.
